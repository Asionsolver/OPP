Disadvantage of Procedural Programming:

Procedural Programming is good, but there is some serious issue we face when we create software for real world. Mapping real world objects, data programming seem really hard when hard when it comes to procedural programming like C.

1. Code is not reusable.
2. Large code base is hard to manage.
3. Difficult to tracing & fixing bugs.
4. Data is exposed to whole program.
5. Here, operation's priority is higher than data.
6. Difficult to relate with real world data.
